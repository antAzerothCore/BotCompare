# BotCompare
Addon for WoW 3.3.5a with NPCBots that streamlines comparing and equipping gear to NPCBots.

Intended for use with a custom server core which implements this functionality through server messages. Will not work with the public NPCBots repositories.

# Features

- Allows you to compare an item in your inventory to a bot's equipped gear.  To do this select a summoned NPCBot and press the [SHIFT] key on your keyboard to show the item comparison tooltip.
- Implements a keybind which equips an item to the selected NPCBot. To use this feature, set a keybind and press it while hovering an item. The item will be equipped to the selected bot if it is a valid selection.
